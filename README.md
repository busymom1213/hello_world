# hello_world
This is my first repository

I'm a software developmen student at Ivy Tech in Indianapolis. I love to problem solve! The only issue I have is that I get into a coding "Black Hole" and can't seem to walk away until I finally find the solution I was looking for. I'm really excited about learning even more because it reminds me of the puzzle games I play and I love to see my code run without kinks!
